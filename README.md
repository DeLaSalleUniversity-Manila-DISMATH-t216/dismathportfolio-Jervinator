#Week 1
After the orientation, I realized how challenging Dismath really is
The first topic that was discussed were about **Truths** and its classifications are:
- **Legal Truth**
- **Authorative Truth**
- **Scientific Truth**
- **Probable Truth**
- **Philosophical Truth**

Having been introduced to the basic logic functions, the lesson became like a review for me.

However even with the knowledge of these logic functions, deep analysis is still a skill for Dismath.

Overall, I learned how challenging Dismath will be this first week.

#Week 2
- I was refreshed on what propositions are and what are its logical equivalences.
- Though I was already familiar with logical functions, the concept of proposition is different and this is where the topic for Quiz 1 revolves.
- I learned the equivalent equation for propositions and this helps simplify complex logical statements
- I learned the difference between universal and existential quantifiers and how they are used in mathematical equations
- The rules of inference were explained to me in detail and little by little I'm beginning to understand it
- Basic Logic Theorems

|         Name        |                           Equivalence                          |	
|:-------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|
|    Identity laws    |                      p ∧ T ≡ p<br>p v F ≡ p               |
|   Domination laws   |                       p v T ≡ T<br>p ∧ F ≡ F               |
|    Negation laws    |                     p v ¬p ≡ T<br>p ∧ ¬p ≡ F                   |
|   De Morgan's laws  |              ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p v ¬q<br>¬(p v q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q      |    |
| Double negation law |                            ¬(¬p) ≡ p                           |
|   Idempotent laws   |                       p v p ≡ p<br>p ∧ p ≡ p               |
|   Commutative laws  |                   p v q ≡ q v p<br>p ∧ q ≡ q ∧ p               |
|   Associative laws  |       (p v q) v r ≡ p v (q v r)<br>(p ∧ q) ∧ r ≡ p ∧ (q ∧ r)   |
|  Distributive laws  | p v (q ∧ r) ≡ (p v q) ∧ (p v r)<br>p ∧(q v r) ≡ (p ∧ q) v (p ∧ r) |
|   Absorption laws   |                 p v (p ∧ q) ≡ p<br>p ∧ (p v q) ≡ p          |   |

#Week 3
The **Rules for Inference** was further discussed and ellaborated and they are:
- **Modus ponens**
- **Modus tollens**
- **Hyopthetical Syllogism**
- **Disjunctive Syllogism**
- **Addition**
- **Simplification**
- **Conjunction**
- **Resolution**

The examples the rules for inference puzzled the class but it still managaeable to learn when understood fully.

#Week 4
For this week the **Methods of Proof** were discussed and they are:
- **Direct Proof**
- **Contraposition**
- **Vacuous Proof**
- **Trivial Proof**

and the concept of *Proof by Contradiction* was introduced but not furtherly discussed yet.

A lot of examples were given for the methods of proof and this is a big help in understanding them further.

#Week 5
- Methods of Proof are emphasized in class because it is very important in Quiz 1 and this helped me learn the basics better
- The **Biconditional Statement** was discussed and when their are 2 statements p and q, both statements must be true when p implies q and q implies p. 
- Induction and Recursive were also discussed and examples for these 2 topics confused the class.

#Week 6
- Examples on Methods of Induction were given to the class and this confused all of us
- Induction has 2 steps
  - Basis Step - this proves whether the given is initially true (Show P(1) ≡ T)
  - Inductive Step - this proves whether the sequence is obediently true (Show that is also P(k+1) true)
- Program Verification was also taught this week and it is based on the basic rules of inference
- It has a process or method called Hoarse Triple wherein it is just a combination of direct proofs
- Hoarse Triple
  - p { S } q = T
