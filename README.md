#Week 1
After the orientation, I realized how challenging Dismath really is
The first topic that was discussed were about **Truths** and its classifications are:
- **Legal Truth**
- **Authorative Truth**
- **Scientific Truth**
- **Probable Truth**
- **Philosophical Truth**

Having been introduced to the basic logic functions, the lesson became like a review for me.

However even with the knowledge of these logic functions, deep analysis is still a skill for Dismath.

Overall, I learned how challenging Dismath will be this first week.

#Week 2
-I was refreshed on what propositions are and what are its logical equivalences.
-Though I was already familiar withh logical functions, the concept of proposition is different and this is where the topic for Quiz 1 revolves.
-I learned the equivalent equation for propositions and this helps simplify complex logical statements
-I learned the difference between universal and existential quantifiers and how they are used in mathematical equations
-The rules of inference were explained to me in detail and little by little I'm beginning to understand it
