#Week 1
- After the orientation, I realized how challenging Dismath really is
- Having been introduced to the basic logic functions, the lesson became like a review for me
- However even with the knowledge of these logic functions, deep analysis is still a skill for Dismath
- Overall, I learned how challenging Dismath will be this first week.

#Week 2
- I was refreshed on what propositions are and what are its logical equivalences
- I learned the difference between universal and existential quantifiers and how they are used in mathematical equations
- The rules of inference were explained to me in detail and little by little I'm beginning to understand it
